In a few different places across the web, the intellectual Sam Harris has repeated a particular argument against the idea that the Bible was written by an omniscient being. In this précis, I want to unpack that argument into some digestible premises, and consider a few different ways they could be interpreted. I’ll conclude by showing where I think the argument goes wrong.

### Improving the Bible
The following transcript from one of Harris’ interviews is a good summary of the argument:

> The fact that you and I could improve the Bible with very little thought (just take out the worst passages that have no possible redeemable content this year or, I would argue, any other year, and the Bible is already improved), […] the fact that we can edit it to anyone’s advantage, is a problem for the idea that this was written by an omniscient being and not to be superseded by any human effort, now or generations from now.<sup>1</sup>

Distilling down the key claims being made, Harris’ argument essentially takes the form of a syllogism.

1. The Bible can be improved.
2. An omniscient being probably wouldn’t write a book that could be improved.
3. Therefore, an omniscient being probably didn’t write the Bible.

I think it is fairly easy to see how premise (1) comes straight from the transcript. As for premise (2), since Harris never fleshes out exactly what the problem is with the Bible being improvable, we can only try our best at a charitable interpretation. This initial statement of the second premise is surely in the ballpark of what Harris had in mind, however, perhaps we could strengthen it in order to force a stronger conclusion.

2. An omniscient being would *never* write a book that could be improved.

This phrasing would allow us to conclude that an omniscient being in fact *did not* write the Bible, not just that it is *unlikely*. In any case, either of these statements of premise (2) seem to be a reasonable interpretation. Whichever statement we prefer, it does not change the argument’s main logical thrust: the Bible can be improved in some way, but if an omniscient being wrote it, that should not be the case.

So, with Harris’ argument reasonably stated and clearly understood, is it compelling? Not at all. In fact, both premises are highly dubious, and for the same reason.

### Problems Improving
For one, the notion of “improving” the Bible is extremely vague. Improved for *who* exactly, or for *what* purpose? By “improved,” Harris probably means something like “more agreeable to our modern ethical sensibilities,” or “more accurate according to modern scientific standards.” However, this way of thinking neglects to consider the impact of a biblical passage on history as a whole. Contrary to Harris, it is plausible that an omniscient God, who knew exactly how each person throughout history would be impacted as a result of reading certain passages of the Bible, would include exactly what he wanted in the Bible in order to accomplish his purposes throughout the *entire* history of the world.

But this point aside, even if we were to grant premise (1) for the sake of argument, premise (2) hardly fares any better. That is because it is still entirely plausible that God in fact *would* write a book that could be “improved” in order to relate to its original audience on their own terms, using references to their culture, and concepts they could understand. In other words, we cannot neglect to consider the original audience of the Bible when thinking about its characteristics and presuppositions. The Old Testament scholar John Walton articulates this point well:

> God has accommodated himself to the world of ancient Israel to initiate that revelation. We therefore recognize that although the Bible is written for us (indeed, for everyone), it is not written to us. In its context, it is not communicated in our language; it is not addressed to our culture; it does not anticipate the questions about the world and its operations that stem from our modern situations and issues.<sup>2</sup>

In short, why think that God only had us modern folks in mind when he wrote the Bible? That is to be guilty of [presentism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentism_(literary_and_historical_analysis)), and is pretty presumptuous, don’t you think? According to Christian thought, just as God revealed himself as Jesus in a particular period of history — which means he followed certain customs, wore certain clothes, and spoke certain languages — God also revealed the Bible into a particular period of history. If that is the case, then it is only natural that the medium of God’s communication would take on some of the characteristics of the period of history in which it was revealed.

The upshot of this way of thinking about God’s omniscience in relation to the Bible is that Christians can rejoice with confidence that the words we have in Scripture today are the *very* words our sovereign God wanted us to have — no matter how they reached their final form, or who their original audience was.
