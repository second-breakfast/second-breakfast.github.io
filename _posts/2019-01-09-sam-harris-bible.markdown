In several places across the web, the public intellectual Sam Harris has repeated an argument against the idea that the Bible was written by an omniscient being. In this précis, I'll unpack that argument into some digestible premises, and consider a few different ways they could be interpreted. I conclude by showing where I think the argument goes wrong.

### Improving the Bible
The following transcript from one of Harris’s interviews is a good summary of the argument:

> The fact that you and I could improve the Bible with very little thought (just take out the worst passages that have no possible redeemable content this year or, I would argue, any other year, and the Bible is already improved), […] the fact that we can edit it to anyone’s advantage, is a problem for the idea that this was written by an omniscient being and not to be superseded by any human effort, now or generations from now.<sup>1</sup>

Distilling down the key claims being made, the argument essentially takes the form of a syllogism.

1. The Bible can be improved.
2. An omniscient being probably wouldn’t write a book that could be improved.
3. Therefore, an omniscient being probably didn’t write the Bible.

I think it is fairly easy to see how the first premise comes straight from the transcript. As for the second premise, since Harris never fleshes out exactly what the problem is supposed to be with the Bible's being improvable, we can only try our best at a charitable interpretation. This initial statement of the second premise is surely in the ballpark of what Harris had in mind. However, perhaps we could strengthen it further in order to force a stronger conclusion.

2. An omniscient being would *never* write a book that could be improved.

This stronger phrasing would allow us to conclude that an omniscient being in fact *did not* write the Bible, not just that it is *unlikely*. In any case, either of these statements of the second premise seem to be a reasonable interpretation. Whichever statement we prefer, it does not change the argument’s main logical thrust: the Bible can be improved in some way, but if an omniscient being wrote it, that should not be the case.

So, with the argument reasonably and clearly stated, is it compelling? Not at all. In fact, both premises are highly dubious, and for ultimately the same reason.

### Improving a Love Letter?
For one, Harris's claim that the Bible can be improved is too vague. Improved for *who* exactly, or for *what* purpose? He never says. Yet, improvement is always relative to some goal. You can say that Jackie Chan's backflip needs improving because he fell; but if his *goal* was to fall for a movie stunt you would be wrong! So, in order to evaluate Harris's claim, it is crucial that we ask: what is the purpose of the Bible?

By the Bible's being “improved,” Harris probably means something like “more agreeable to our modern ethical sensibilities,” or “more accurate according to modern scientific standards.” However, if that is what he means, then he would be completely neglecting the Bible's *own claims* about why it was given to us (cf. Isaiah 55:10-11; Psalm 19:7-11, 119:9; John 20:30-31; 2 Tim 3:15-17; Hebrews 4:12; 1 John 5:13). Is it really plausible that God wrote the Bible in order to provide the ancients with modern scientific knowledge? No. It is, rather, much more plausible that God gave us the Bible for the reason it says he did: in order to provide us with knowledge of himself and to know how to follow him.

If that is the purpose of the Bible, then we must consider its impact on history *as a whole*. Contrary to Harris, it is plausible that an omniscient being, who knew exactly how each person throughout history would be impacted as a result of reading certain passages of the Bible, would include *exactly* what he wanted in the Bible in order to accomplish his purposes throughout the *entire* history of the world. So, the first premise of Harris's argument is simply not compelling; it amounts to nitpicking a love letter written to someone else in a different time.

But, even if we were to grant the first premise for the sake of argument, the second premise hardly fares any better. That is because it is still entirely plausible that an omniscient being in fact *would* write a book that could be “improved” in order to relate to its original audience on their own terms, using references to their culture and concepts they could understand. In other words, we cannot neglect to consider the original audience of the Bible when thinking about its characteristics and presuppositions. The Old Testament scholar John Walton articulates this point well:

> God has accommodated himself to the world of ancient Israel to initiate that revelation. We therefore recognize that although the Bible is written for us (indeed, for everyone), it is not written to us. In its context, it is not communicated in our language; it is not addressed to our culture; it does not anticipate the questions about the world and its operations that stem from our modern situations and issues.<sup>2</sup>

According to Christian thought, just as the God of Israel revealed himself as Jesus in a particular period of history — which means he followed certain customs, wore certain clothes, and spoke certain languages — God also revealed the Bible into particular periods of history. But if that is the case, then it is only natural that the Bible would take on some of the characteristics and values of the period of history in which it was revealed. As the theologians of old put it, the Bible contains the words of God, in the words of men.

In conclusion, Harris’s argument against the Bible is unpersuasive. The first premise, that the Bible can be improved, is vague and only makes sense if one makes the assumption that the purpose of the Bible is to convey modern scientific knowledge or some other such nonsense. But if the purpose of the Bible is to help us know God, and it meets that purpose perfectly (it seems to do a pretty good job), then the claim that the Bible can be improved loses all force. Similarly, even if the first premise were true, the second premise, that an omniscient being would (never) write a book that could be improved, also fails. Especially given our discussion of the purpose of the Bible, it is entirely plausible that an omniscient being would *want* to write book that could be “improved” in order to more effectively communicate to his people on their level, and help them to know him better.

Reflecting on the fact that the words we have in the Bible today are plausibly the *very* words our omniscient God wanted us to have — he knew how they would reach their final form, regardless of who their original audience was — should cause Christians to rejoice with confidence.
