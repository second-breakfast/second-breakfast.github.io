In various interviews across the interwebs, Sam Harris, a public intellectual and one of the leading New Atheists, has articulated an argument against the idea that the Bible is divinely inspired. In this précis, I'll unpack the logical form of Harris's argument, and consider its merits in light of what the Bible says about its own inspiration. I conclude by showing where I think the argument goes wrong.

### The Argument Stated
The following transcript from one of Harris’s interviews is a good summary of the argument:

> The fact that you and I could improve the Bible with very little thought (just take out the worst passages that have no possible redeemable content this year or, I would argue, any other year, and the Bible is already improved), […] the fact that we can edit it to anyone’s advantage, is a problem for the idea that this was written by an omniscient being and not to be superseded by any human effort, now or generations from now. […] Just think about how good a book would be if an omniscient being wrote it. It's very easy to see what could be in there that would still astonish us. It's very easy to see what could be in there that would prove, just based on the time of its emergence, that this couldn't have been the product of merely human minds. <sup>1</sup>

If we distill the claims made in the transcript above, the argument basically takes the form of a syllogism:

1. The Bible can be improved.
2. An omniscient being probably wouldn’t write a book that could be improved.
3. Therefore, an omniscient being probably didn’t write the Bible.

It is easy to see how the first premise comes straight from the transcript. As for the second premise, since Harris never specifies exactly why the fact that the Bible can be improved is a problem, we can only try our best at a charitable interpretation. The initial statement of the second premise above is probably in the ballpark of what Harris has in mind, however, perhaps we could make it stronger in order to force a stronger conclusion:

{:start="2"}
2. An omniscient being would *never* write a book that could be improved.

This stronger phrasing of the second premise would allow us to conclude that an omniscient being in fact *did not* write the Bible, not just that it is *unlikely*. In any case, either of these statements of the second premise seem to be a reasonable interpretation of what Harris is saying. Whichever statement we prefer, it does not change the first argument’s main logical thrust: the Bible can be improved in some way, but if an omniscient being wrote it, that should not be the case.

Is this argument compelling? Not at all. In fact, both premises can be questioned. Furthermore, as we will see, the argument as a whole relies on a dubious assumption about the purpose of the Bible which can also be questioned.

### The Argument Analyzed

The most obvious problem with Harris's argument is the vague claim that the Bible can be improved. Improved for *who* exactly, or for *what* purpose? Harris never explicitly says. Yet, improvement is always relative to some goal. You can say that Jackie Chan's backflip can be improved because he fell; but if his *goal* was to fall for a movie stunt you would be wrong! So, in order to evaluate this argument, it is crucial that we consider what Harris has in mind when he talks about improving the Bible. And if the improvement of a thing is relative to its purpose, then it is also crucial that we consider what Harris thinks, in turn, about the following question: what is the purpose of the Bible?

#### The Purpose of the Bible
If we look carefully at the way Harris talks about improving the Bible in various other books and interviews, he most likely has in mind two specific ways that the Bible can be improved.<sup>2</sup> First, Harris thinks the Bible can be improved by being updated to be more in line with modern people's ethical views about various social issues as sex and marriage. Second, Harris thinks the Bible can be improved by being made more accurate according to modern scientific standards. These ways that Harris thinks the Bible can be improved reveal what he thinks the purpose of the Bible is: to give us moral or scientific facts.

Now, if this is what Harris thinks the purpose of the Bible is, then it is easy to see why he thinks it can be improved. However, is it really plausible to think that God wrote the Bible merely in order to provide the ancients with futuristic scientific knowledge that they couldn't have gotten otherwise? Not at all. Rather, when we take a look at the Bible's *own claims* about why it was given to us, we see a different picture. According to the Bible itself, the reason it was given to mankind was to provide us with knowledge of God (cf. John 20:31, 1 John 5:13), to bring God's people comfort and joy during times of persecution (cf. Psalm 119:28,35,45,47,52), and to cause us to consider our attitudes and behavior in light of God's good character (cf. 2 Timothy 3:16, Hebrews 4:12). So, rather than merely provide us with specific answers to all the random questions we could throw at it, the Bible is instead intended to lead us to wisdom (cf. Provers 2:6).

In short, the problem with the first premise in Harris's argument is that he imposes a standard on the Bible that it was never intended to meet. Harris assumes that the purpose of the Bible is to provide us with certain kinds of factual knowledge, rather than considering what the Bible says about its own purpose, which is to provide us with wisdom and knowledge of God. When evaluated in the context of wisdom rather than facts, most of Harris's complaints about taking out the "worst" passages of the Bible disappear, for perhaps struggling with those difficult passages was intended to lead us to wisdom rather than all the right answers after all.

#### Futuristic Facts and Time Travel Paradoxes
So much for the first premise of Harris's argument. However, even if we were to grant that premise for the sake of argument, the second premise also faces problems. The key question here is why an omniscient being would write a book that would become "outdated" over time. Or, to put it another way, why wouldn't an omniscient being include futuristic knowledge in the Bible to somehow prove its divine inspiration? As Harris puts it, why couldn't God just have put in a modern fact, perhaps from quantum mechanics, that would prove, "just based on the time of its emergence, that this couldn't have been the product of merely human minds."

Given our previous discussion about the purpose of the Bible above, it should already be clear that the very question is wrongheaded. It already assumes that the purpose of the Bible is to somehow prove God's existence by including some futuristic facts that couldn't have been the product of merely human minds. But if that isn't the purpose of the Bible, then asking why God didn't do that becomes a non sequitur.

However, just for giggles, perhaps we can face the question more directly in order to show its absurdity. Does it even make sense to think that an omniscient being would *want* to include some specific random futuristic knowldge in the Bible, or that it would even be *possible*? Think about the original audience of the Bible: given that they would lack the background to even understand, say, the theorems of quantum mechanics, including futuristic knowledge from physics would make absolutely no sense to them. Furthermore, an omniscient being would know whether providing futuristic knowledge in the Bible would lead to unfavorable historical consequences, since he would be able to see into the future. In fact, the very notion of providing people in the past with too much specific futuristic knowledge arguably leads to time-traveler-like paradoxes. For instance, perhaps if God were to give too much specific futuristic knowledge to people in the past such as Moses, it would disrupt God's plans for Israel's future, causing a later prophet never to be born.

#### An Accommodating God
These absurdities aside, and contrary to Harris, it is rather entirely plausible that an omniscient being would want write a book that would relate to its original audience on their own terms, using references to their culture and concepts they could understand, even if that meant such a book could be “improved” to us modern people. The Old Testament scholar John Walton articulates this point well:

> God has accommodated himself to the world of ancient Israel to initiate that revelation. We therefore recognize that although the Bible is written for us (indeed, for everyone), it is not written to us. In its context, it is not communicated in our language; it is not addressed to our culture; it does not anticipate the questions about the world and its operations that stem from our modern situations and issues.<sup>3</sup>

Indeed, according to Christian thought, just as the God of Israel revealed himself as Jesus of Nazareth in a particular period of history — which means he followed certain customs, wore certain clothes, and spoke certain languages — God also revealed the Bible into particular periods of history. If that is the case, then it is only natural that the Bible would take on some of the characteristics and values of the period of history in which it was revealed. As the theologians of old put it, the Bible contains the words of God, in the words of men.

Thus, the second premise of Harris's argument is also problematic. It relies on the unmotivated assumption that the purpose of the Bible is to provide people with futuristic knowledge, and that an omniscient being *could* do that in the first place, without disrupting his other plans for history.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, Harris’s argument against the Bible is unpersuasive. The first premise, that the Bible can be improved, is vague and only makes sense if one makes the assumption that the purpose of the Bible is to convey modern scientific knowledge or some other such knowldge. But if the purpose of the Bible is to give us wisdom and help us know God, then Harris's claim that the Bible can be improved loses most of its force. Similarly, even if the first premise were true, the second premise, that an omniscient being would never write a book that could be improved, also fails. Especially given our discussion of the purpose of the Bible, it is entirely plausible that an omniscient being would *want* to write book that could be “improved” in order to more effectively communicate to Israel using their culture, and to accomplish his specific purposes later in history.

Reflecting on the fact that the words in the Bible today are arguably the *very* words an omniscient God would want us to have — i.e. he knew how they would reach their final form, regardless of who their original audience was — should cause believers to savor the fact that Scripture can still speak to us today.
